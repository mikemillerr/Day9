    "Linear Regression is a method for interpolating and extrapolating data. In the case of simple linear regression, you have one dependent variable y and one independent variable x.  By applying the least sqarred error on the residuals LG fitts a line through this data points in a why that the sum of those errors are minimised. \n",

For example for two independent variables we get a plane. For higher dimensional problems the shape of the minimised LSE become hard to imagen.\n"
